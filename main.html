	<p>Many times there are more than one ways to solve a problem with 
		different algorithms and we need a way to compare multiple ways.
		Also, there are situations where we would like to know how much
		time and resources an algorithm might take when implemented.
		To measure performance of algorithms, we typically use
		time and space complexity analysis.
		The idea is to measure order of growths in terms of input size.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Independent of the machine and its configuration, on which the algorithm is running on.</li>
        <li>Shows a direct correlation with the number of inputs.</li>
        <li>Can distinguish two algorithms clearly without ambiguity.</li>
    </ol>
